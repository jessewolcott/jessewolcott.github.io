title: Bucket List
---

I love to plan vacations, and when I do so, I plan them around specific bucket-list items. I don't travel constantly, so I like to make sure that when I do, it counts. 

## USA
### Tennessee
* Lost Sea Adventure, Sweetwater, TN - Largest underground lake in the US

## Iceland
* Grimsey - Orbis et Globus - 7 ton metal ball that marks the Arctic Circle. Moves 14 meters every year, and will be out to sea in less than 20.
