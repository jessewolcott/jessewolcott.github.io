title: Calendly for Personal Use

I hate Calendly. Not because of the functionality that it offers, mind you, but because of how folks use it (chiefly Sales and Recruiting). I think its a neat concept, as a daily user of a calendar to keep my life together. Their product is decent, and essentially free for personal use.
