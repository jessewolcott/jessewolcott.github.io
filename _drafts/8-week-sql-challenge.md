Whenever an idea seems out of reach, I always seem to circle back around to it. I have been interested in data analysis and trending big data since I learned it was at thing. I didn't need to see the movie [Moneyball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) to understand that data leads to better decision making... If properly analyzed. I have (exhaustively) mentioned a core weakness of mine, that I need a problem to solve to learn. Standard classes are very difficult for me to ingest, because I do not understand how they would apply. Thankfully, some folks are realizing that, and making things like [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) to help.

There are a few others that also seem interesting:
