LogicMonitor is probably the best on-premise monitoring tool out there today. It has so much configurability and flexibility that its daunting to figure out how to even make use of it. In the initial setup, I needed a quick inventory of Alert Rules and their associated Escalation Chain. Thankfully, [Steve Villardi](https://github.com/stevevillardi) made a really nice Powershell module to help.
