One of my weightlifting coaches is a super interesting guy (all of my coaches are, but this project wasn't their idea). He is incredibly logical and forward with not only his ideas, but his communication style. While we were lifting the other night, he brought up the idea of making a bot using ChatGPT, and how that probably speaks louder on a GitHub project page than another powershell script. He's right! I don't know what I'd use one for, but the idea of cloud appliance that does something relevant to my life is neat.
