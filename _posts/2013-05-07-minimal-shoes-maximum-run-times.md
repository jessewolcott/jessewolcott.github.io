So, I’m writing this post from Windows Live Writer, and it bears striking resemblance to Office 2010. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised by that. I’ve cleaned up the site, removed some things, and will be adding my projects.

Couple of things have happened since my last update. I’ve torn my meniscus, and had it repaired. I’ve lifted my maxes and hurt my knee again. I’ve entered physical therapy. My shoes (some new balance horribly grey shoes) had in excess of probably 350 miles on them, not to mention countless gym hours, and I’d been eyeing up the New Balance MT00BG’s for some time. They are minimal, and very light weight. In my first run on them last night (just 2 miles) I feel great. No pain!

I hope to be able to get the garden box in this weekend, assuming I’ll have the free time. I need to get the grass mowed, get the [Thankful Paws]("https://www.jessewolcott.com/thankfulpaws/) site updated with the info provided. Now that I think about it, the [Baltimore Color Run](http://thecolorrun.com/baltimore/) is this weekend, so that’ll fill up Sunday into the early afternoon. After a race, brunch is always necessary.

I keep meaning to order a donut pan and cutter. I have too many recipes to try. I need to listen to Pimsleur, make donuts and cut the grass at the same time. I’m not certain, but if I wasn’t so concerned with the look of my lawn, I’d hire someone to do it. The time investment is great, and its taking up some time that I could likely use for other, more creative endeavors.

So, lets go over this, for posterities sake. Donuts. Grass mowing. Arduino project layout. Gardening. Running. Physical Therapy.

So much to do. Hope to write soon!
