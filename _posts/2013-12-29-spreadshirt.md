I started a store on “Spreadshirt”. Its a pretty neat site, where you can, essentially, open up a store, like cafepress. I’m not sure I notice a REAL distinction between cafepress and spreadshirt… The possible exception being a stigma related towards cafepress products. I made these shirts because I think they’re cool, and I would (and DO intend to) wear them.

The site is embedded up at the top (See [T-Shirt Design](https://www.jessewolcott.com/t-shirt-design/) in the top bar). You can also head over to the ACTUAL site, on spreadshirt’s site at <http://wolcott-tshirt-explosion.spreadshirt.com>.
