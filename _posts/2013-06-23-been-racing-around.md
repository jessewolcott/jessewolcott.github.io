Ok, phew! The last 7 days has been a whirlwind, so, this’ll mark the “catch up” post! On June 15, I ran the [Baltimore 10 Miler](http://www.baltimoretenmiler.com), with Laura, so that was cool:

The premium was the fresh jackets you see us wearing. Just for fun, this was after 10 miles of running in the heat of mid-Jun. We were wearing jackets, and I was very warm. Was a good race, great support. They have something that I’ve never had with another race, a giant tub of ice water that they dunk washcloths in and hand out at the finish line.

Laura and I ran the race together, and we finished in 2:00:37.60, but I stopped to pee at mile 5. To answer your question, yes, I’m furious that my bladder couldn’t get it together and made me finish over 2 hours slightly. I’m also SLIGHTLY embarrassed that it took me 2 hours, but considering that I had knee surgery in January, and I’m running a 10 miler in June, I can call this a victory. We can only get better from here, right?

So, after a few short training runs after physical therapy (which I wouldn’t recommend, wreaks havoc on the body to train legs then run in the same day…), we had another race yesterday, June 22, called, aptly, [the Dreaded Druid Hills 10k](http://dreadeddruidhills.com/). It started at the Druid Hill lake, and ran through a ridiculous series of hills. I’ve never run an officially recorded 10k before, but 1:12 seems like a reasonable time for that course. In my best effort, I ran a relatively flat 5k at 28:58. I think 10k could be a really good distance to train for, and train towards. Oh, and since I made a “Nailed it!” for the 10 miler, I made one for the Dreaded Druid Hills, too. A-like-dis:

Laura is going away to the beach from Thursday to Sunday this week, so i’m searching for another event. For so long, I’ve concerned myself with picking events that have awesome premiums that I’ve ended up with very few tech shirts. So, now I’m sorta reaching out with both hands and grabbing events as they come up. Not sure what, if any, event I’m going to do this weekend, but I hope the answer is non-zero. Couple of possibilities, I’m not whetted to anything in particular, but I’m leaning towards the [the Ellicott City 10k](http://www.ec5k.com/home.html), and Vince and Carlie seem interested… so… maybe thats it? There is no info on the site about whether there is a shirt for a premium… I’m not paying for no shirt!!
