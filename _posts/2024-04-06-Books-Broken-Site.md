title: That time I had a blog

Yikes, I broke this blog on github and forgot to continue writing. I've mentioned that I write a lot, but I haven't mentioned that most of it isn't even useful. I'm trying to stay creative and relevant, and in the process, flipped my github repo for this site to "private" and nuked all the automation that builds it. Oooof.

I got a new job, so lots going on there. Not as much time to read, but working hard to stay fit, keep reading and writing, and not go nuts. The worst kind of post is the "I should write here more" and I'm certainly guilty of that, but hey... We do what we can! 

I am currently reading a book of poetry by an ancient Roman named Catallus. It is not particularly noteworthy, and I find a lot of it super boring and tired. It has illustrated to me that, even 2000 years ago, people were basically the same as they are now. Catallus wrote about 2 things: 
* How much he loved his girlfriend and how everyone should look at their love and kill themselves because they will never have that kind of love so why bother living
* How each person that wronged him was awful 

We haven't evolved since ancient Rome at all.
