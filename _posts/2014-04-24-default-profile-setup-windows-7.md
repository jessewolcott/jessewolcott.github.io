Ok, quick note… Today I learned that “C:\\Users\\All Users\\Desktop\\” is deprecated, and therefore inaccessible in Windows 7.

The trick is “C:\\Users\\Public\\Desktop\\”. This makes absolutely no sense to me, and I do not understand why this change was made. Whatever! Additionally, my Windows 8.1 box took an HOUR to install updates yesterday. Windows Update… Get it together!
