So, after downloading ANOTHER WordPress desktop publishing app for OSX (and hoping for the best), I’m going to give this a shot. You can try it here [in this link to the Apple App Store.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelpumper/id595901917?mt=12)

I’ve been doing some good work on the site. Really mapping things out. I want to do a wood-block transfer for my garden, and transfer a picture that says “Marvin Gardens” to my actual garden. Suppose I should get the planter box built first. Dan brought up an interesting point, about the sides bowing out. I hadn’t considered that they’d do that. Maybe I’ll lay the gravel layer and see how things go. I’m reading more about tomatoes, and I’m almost certainly over-watering. Must make sure to dial that back… In addition, I’m thinking just an inch of gravel, so that I can have a nice, very deep bed for the garden. I hope to get the tomatoes on one side, zucchini on the other (as they tell me that its a fairly aggressive plant… maybe even I can grow it!) and, if all goes well, try to find a Kiowa blackberry bush to plant. 3″ fruit from Kiowa blackberry bushes, can you believe that?

Must register for my next race. Vince and Carlie are doing the [Savage Race 2013](http://www.savagerace.com/maryland2013) in July, but I’m still torn. I might need to find some less expensive endeavors to fill my time until this fall.

Pixelpumper seems nice, although the (apparent) complete lack of keyboard shortcuts is, at least, disconcerting, and at most, a deal breaker.
