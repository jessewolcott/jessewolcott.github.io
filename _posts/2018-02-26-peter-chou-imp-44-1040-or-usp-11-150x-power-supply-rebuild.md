I picked up a Neo Geo 4 slot at the request of a friend (lets call it a commission work, I guess?). It had a power supply in it that was rusty and dirty and loud as can be. It was this model:

Now, you can just go get a replacement for this, and thats what I did. Twisted Quarter still has them for $50 which is a spicy meatball if you’re trying to make a profit (especially since those dudes are seemingly incapable of shipping something for less than $15). So that sucks, but it is an option.

Since apparently 2018 is the year of rebuilding power supplies, here’s the cap list:

As always, Joe over at <https://syracusesemiconductors.com/> was very accommodating when I emailed him to request a custom kit. I’m going to get him to try to add it to his site, but you know how that goes. How many people are actually going to recap these things?

The fan is an 80mm by 80mm by 25mm 12vdc fan, same as most of the other PSUs I rebuild (apparently). So I just used [this dude from Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/ARCTIC-AFACO-08000-GBA01-F8-Standard-Effecient/dp/B00NTUJZ36/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1519660715&sr=8-5&keywords=80mm%2Bfan&th=1), since it sold as a 5 pack, and prime, and thats awesome.
