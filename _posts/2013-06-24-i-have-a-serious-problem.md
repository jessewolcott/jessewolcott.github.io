I have an issue. Its difficult for me to accept it, and to reach out and ask, nay… beg for help.

I’m addicted to running events. I ran the [Baltimore 10 Miler](http://www.baltimoretenmiler.com), then 7 days later I ran the [Dreaded Druid Hills 10k](http://dreadeddruidhills.com). I’ve now registered for [some allegedly moonlight 5k](http://www.eliteracemanagement.com/moonlight-5k-2013/) in Bel Air on Saturday, June 29, and a [10k in Ellicott City](http://www.ec5k.com/home.html) in Sunday, June 30. After that, Laura and I are going to Tampa on vacation where, in a move surprising no one, I’ve registered for a race.

Just a 5k this time, though. Actually, it looks pretty neat, [if you check out their site.](www.kiwanismidnightrun.com) I wish more races would put the information for their premium online. Baltimore seems to be a hot-spot for “Premiums that kick ass, so we’d better put them on the internets.”

Maybe I’ll chill out after that. Dave is running [the Charles Street 12 miler](http://www.charlesst12.com), which, while looking fun and promising a sweet hoodie sweatshirt, is $85 American dollars. I don’t know if I can hang with THAT.

Still have to figure out exactly what half marathon we’re going to be doing. I’m sorta jazzed about the [Gasparilla OMFG Clusterbang of races](http://www.tampabayrun.com/) in February, which includes not only a half-marathon, but a much needed break from the cold weather, at that point. That’ll be an interesting weekend… 15k and a 5k on Saturday, then eating all the food possible, then a half-marathon and an 8k on Sunday? Just sadistic enough to be the best thing ever.
