I began to think… What about roasting my own almonds? I bet Old Bay almonds would be great. Turns out they are.

1. Put 1 TSP of vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet, and put in the oven. Preheat to 350 degrees F.
2. Put 1 cup of raw almonds in the pan, and toss them around to coat them with the now-hot oil.
3. Bake for 9 minutes
4. Take out, and generously apply seasoning of choice. Back in the oven for 1 minute.
5. Take out, and remove them from the cast iron immediately, only wax paper or something like that (or else they’ll keep cooking)
6. Let cool for about an hour.
7. Snack your face off.

I made Nacho Cheese almonds too. They’re pretty good, as well!
