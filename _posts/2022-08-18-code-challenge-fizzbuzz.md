I recently interviewed for a position with a company that was very much an “individual contributor” role. I have used powershell for loads of things throughout my life but was never testing in real time, so it was interesting and fun to have it be part of my interview. A lot of “classically training” coders start out with intense math as part of their educational core, so during this interview, I learned about % as the remainder function and elseif. I posted it over on my GitHub!
