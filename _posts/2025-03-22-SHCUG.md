I swear, if I look back and count the times I've said "I need to write more", I'd run out of fingers and toes to count on! Turns out, that might be selling myself short... I am writing, its just in a million different places. I have been working on a few different projects (never one to just chill out, of course), the most notable of which is my new site, [Scale HyperCore User Group](https://www.shcug.com). My biggest trepidation in choosing Scale Computing for my infrastructure refresh at work last year was simply that NO ONE online was talking about it. The company itself is 17 years old... How is it possible that they have less of an online footprint than I do? Regardless, I learned a lot and collected a few scars, so now I've been over there, writing on that site. 

But hey... As it goes, I've touched this site, so I do indeed remember that it exists. The Jekyll theme on here is not great... I should overhaul this again.
