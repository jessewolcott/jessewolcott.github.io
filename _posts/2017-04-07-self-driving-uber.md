Nick and I are in Pittsburgh for a convention, and we hailed an Uber last night, and were informed that we were going to be driven in a self-driving car. I could have died, I was so excited. I had all expectations of a car rolling up and us getting in, but it was “operated”. I guess they’d call that a driverless car, not a self-driving.

There was an engineer with a laptop in the front passenger seat, and on his screen, it showed what the car “saw”. It was a very short ride, but I was speechless. We live in the future!
