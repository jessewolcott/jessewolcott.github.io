After Gizmo left, it became pretty aggressively clear that I can‚Äôt be alone in a house with no dog. I emailed our contact at Lab Rescue, and i got this back:

> Hi, Jesse. I have a gorgeous black boy ready for you at Towson. His name is Midnight. 18 months old, 65 pounds, and got neutered on 12/1. He‚Äôs ready to go. He‚Äôll be announced tomorrow and I can send you his profile, but he‚Äôs good with other dogs. Could you get him tomorrow? Thanks so much. Yes, I can take the cone on Sunday. Thank you!&lt;

So I head over to Towson Veterinary hospital, leash in hand, and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for Midnight‚Äù. There is no fanfare (like with Gizmo) and no warnings or anything, just a few moments later, a wild bucking bronco appears in the waiting room, choking himself on my leash which has been used as a slip lead. For about 20 seconds, I try to put the harness on him, before giving up, as a totally useless pursuit. The hapless vet tech looks at me struggling and says ‚Äúdo you want a collar or something‚Äù and i‚Äôm like ‚Äúyes, please, for gods sake‚Äù. So we get a collar, and i wrestle him into the car, and its all good. In addition to several other things, I learned that I can‚Äôt make it to Towson and back in a lunch break.

Got him home and he was obviously very strong, and not trained well. He‚Äôd sit if you had his full attention, though! Additionally, he was house-trained, in that he didn‚Äôt 1 or 2 in the house. Midnight was a special boy, very playful, exceptionally cuddly. He had tape on his tail, because he has ‚ÄúHappy Tail‚Äù, and believe me, if you caught a tail wag, it hurt!

Its important to note (and I‚Äôm not certain that I have elsewhere) that we don‚Äôt really get much history on these dogs. The intake form for Midnight said basically that he lived outside, or in the crate. I find the latter claim dubious (at best). Midnight had puppy energy, and separation anxiety (for sure). Thanks to the holidays, we didn‚Äôt really get a chance to ‚Äútrain‚Äù him for either the crate or out of separation anxiety, which made it so that we essentially couldn‚Äôt leave him alone. He was really great, though, and super cute. I don‚Äôt know why people think 18 month old dogs are couch potatoes. I‚Äôll go on record as saying that they settle down around 3-5 and some NEVER slow down, especially without properly being trained.

We had a couple interested in Midnight the second night we had him. They were interested in another dog to help their dog ‚Äústay young‚Äù. This dog, a 12 year old husky, was not really SUPER interested, so, away they went. Another couple came, allegedly they were dog walkers and dog sitters, and had a 12 year old chihuahua. The 12 year old chihuahua didn‚Äôt like Midnight, which is like, the most ‚Äúno shit!‚Äù thing that has ever been written on this blog, but for dog walkers, dog sitters, etc, these people were REALLY unprepared for a 1.5 year old dog. Like, to the point that the husband had the chihuahua in his arms and was jumping back, almost scared of Midnight.

A week came and went with no hits, and then the flood gates opened, and we got 3 hits in 24 hours. Some folks with 2 other dogs called us, and we set up the hot date, and they met and went home with him. He loves playing with their 3 year old Chocolate lab, and they‚Äôre working with a dog behavior specialist to figure him out around cats, and to calm him down. Happy endings üôÇ More pics after the jump.
