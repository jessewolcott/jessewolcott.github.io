I think I’ve mentioned this before, but [Black Hog BBQ](http://www.blackhogbbq.com/) in Frederick, MD is so good. It sounds crazy to say “If you want the best BBQ I’ve ever had, go to a place in downtown Frederick, MD,” but thats my honest opinion. Weird, right?

I’m a huge fan of yellow mustard sauce (thats South Carolina style, if you’re playing along with the home game.) Everyone associates “Carolina Style” with that North Carolina vinegar-based sauce, which, when done properly, is EXCELLENT, is a far cry from yellow-mustard South Carolina style. I had about 5 trips to Columbia, SC for work, where I first indulged my curiosity in this style, and I really enjoy it. Black Hog has a yellow mustard sauce, and when you order their wings with this yellow mustard sauce, its like being air-lifted 600 miles south. So good.

The ribs are the star, though. They come in two flavors, dry (dry rubbed) or wet (kansas city style). The Kansas City style is the ticket, though, and its that sweet, spicy sauce that keeps me coming back. This place is just too good. The prices for a full rack of ribs, an order of wings, and a soda was $35, which is pricy, to be sure, but a really great deal. BBQ places in baltimore seem to have no problem charged $22 for a small rack, so when you get a plate like the one picture below, the cost is well worth it!
