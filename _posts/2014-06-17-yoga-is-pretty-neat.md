I just found this video again. Its years-old by now, but still really cool.

I think, though, that the doctors told him he wouldn’t walk again because the amount of work he put into his recovery is not common. Saying “You can walk again!” to most people doesn’t mean “if you follow an especially rigorous rehabilitation regime, you can walk again”. I don’t know.

Still a good video.
