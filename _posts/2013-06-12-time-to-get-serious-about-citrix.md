I’ve begun my studying for my CCA cert, and to be honest, it seems pretty straightforward. Citrix seem to be one of those products that, if you believe the book, is VERY straightforward, and logical. In practice, I’m SURE that its far more complicated and dumb than that, but I’m very used to dealing with that… (looking at you, [OSX Server](http://www.apple.com/osx/server/)).

I’m trying to compile the most complete set of resources that I’m able to, using all the books and videos I can gather. Additionally, I’m thinking about a CBT nuggets subscription… But I’m not sure about that one yet. I want to pass this, suddenly, and I want to destroy it!

I’m going to try to have a push at work among the team to get certified like crazy. It’s a good goal, and one that I think I can rally support behind!
