ArkInventory did not include a ready-made category for the rare bait items in Legion, so I made a rule for it. Hope this helps!

```itemstring( 133701, 133702, 133703, 133704, 133705, 133707, 133708, 133709, 133710, 133711, 133712, 133713, 133714, 133715, 133716, 133717, 133719, 133720, 133721, 133722, 133723, 133724, 133795, 139175 )```
