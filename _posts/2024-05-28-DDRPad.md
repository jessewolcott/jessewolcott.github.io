title: DDR Pad from China!
author: jesse.wolcott

I ordered a Dance Dance Revolution pad from China, on a whim. I saw a lot of people discussing the thing online, and very few credible sources actually critiquing in a way that I felt comfortable with. I place a lot of importance on tool selection, so when I come across a video where the person talking doesn't understand the tools they are using, and cannot seem to grasp what "value engineering" is, I immediately discount their opinion. Probably more than I should; not sure if I should work on that or not. I received this pad from China, and its fine. I made a video review of it!
