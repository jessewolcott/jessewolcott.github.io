Mail applications seem to have become increasingly popular as a “revolution to the way you work.” I just got an email for [Mail Pilot](http://www.mailpilot.co/), which promises to allow me the exciting ability to “Experience intuitive email with a simple, task-oriented approach.” That might be awesome, but I’ll never know.

Email to my personal accounts is usually not that serious. I don’t know if I’m in the minority here, in that I do not use imap, pop, or gmail for my work email… My work email being the one that could TRULY benefit from a simple, task oriented approach. [Mailstrom](https://mailstrom.co) is another one of these email services…

All o these things offer truly innovative features, and are really fantastic. BUT, none of them support MS Exchange, so they are completely useless for those of us with work email hosted in a Windows environment.
