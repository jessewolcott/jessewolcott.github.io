This evening, I got around to messing with the Arduino again, but tonight, I made great progress. The picture you see below is a serial output of the light on my desk.

I think I need to buy a wireless shield or an ethernet shield. I need to figure out the twitter / email / SMS libraries, and I canâ€™t do that without network connectivity.

I really like messing around with this. Its teaching me a lot.
