Iâ€™m working furiously on a new-ish project, because I want to help the guy behind http://www.getmacapps.com. I started building other scripts over at my github. There is so much to do, and so very little time!

Also, markdown is useful, and fine, I guess, for github to use, but man there are some GLARING errors in the code that are really irritating.
