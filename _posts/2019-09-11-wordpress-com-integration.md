Sometime between the last time I regularly updated this blog and now, Red Sweater upgraded MarsEdit to a new version, and WordPress.com got their act together with JetPack and made their desktop client work.

The worst sentence on the internet, but here it goes: “I hope to blog more”. This site was super updated for a bit, and now nothing. Sad. Talk to you soon!
