I’m getting the pre-run jitters for this Color Run.

Its a 5k, and Laura and I ran 3.04 last night. I shouldn’t be worried.

Whats intriguing to me is that I badly want to take my camera (were it that I had a Go Pro!), but I’m torn between wanting pictures and being worried that everything will be covered in cornstarch-color-powder. I’m more worried about my shoes than anything, they’re going to be multicolored for quite a while, I’d guess.

Back to the gym soon. Will feel good to have an accessory program (for knee strength and hamstring mobility) to go with my heavy lifts.
