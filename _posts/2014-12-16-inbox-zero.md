There is a big to-do about “Inbox Zero,” which is a concept that, as closely as I can tell, started with Merlin Mann, a known productivity guru.

There is a google talk about it (here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk>). Its basically “Email is work. It sucks, and its overwhelming. As awesome it is, we are constantly bombarded, and things slip through the cracks. The system you should put into place is to have no email.”

I’m hoping to take this on as my method for email management in 2015. This is my “resolution,” but I’ve been going for about a week. You should try it too!
