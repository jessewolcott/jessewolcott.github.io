I’m looking at [Arduino Microcontroller Boards](http://www.arduino.cc), like I mentioned yesterday. They seem to be the biggest source of “I have no idea how to do any sort of electrical engineering, and I need to start somewhere.” Interestingly enough, it seems like there are plenty of options to lay out my schematics, and APPARENTLY, [CircuitLab](http://www.circuitlab.com) is a thing… Huge site, chrome plugin, and all. Time to get some schematics cranking.
