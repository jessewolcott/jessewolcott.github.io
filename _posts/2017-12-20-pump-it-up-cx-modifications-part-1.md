Just got back from Ohio, where I picked up another Pump it Up machine, this time, for keeps! Its a Japanese CX model, which is the same as the international model, but about a foot shorter in the header. Its interesting to open these pads up, since I’ve never messed with this newer version, and there are some interesting and important changes that Andamiro implemented.

The first thing that I noticed was that, in spite of the fact that the pad lights are LEDs, they seemed a bit anemic. After opening them up, I noticed a few neat things. First, there is a 12v header to add more lights, and that the original spec is 3 5050 sized warm colored LEDs. This means that adding LEDs of my own would be very easy.

So, I wired up the LED panels that I basically use for everything, and it really pops! Here’s the link to buy them: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/10X-Cool-White-RV-1141-1156-BA15S-T10-921-194-48-SMD-Panel-Interior-LED-Lights/201161822452?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;\_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649](https://www.ebay.com/itm/10X-Cool-White-RV-1141-1156-BA15S-T10-921-194-48-SMD-Panel-Interior-LED-Lights/201161822452?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)

I also like the cooler color, it lets the arrow acrylic design really dictate the color, and looks more crisp. The photo makes it look like the new panels make it look washed out, and I think thats just a camera trick, because it definitely looks awesome in real life!

The sensor triggers have foam on them, so next up is the gorilla tape, and replacing the screws with something shinier. More soon!
