Today is System Administrator’s Day.

Nurses and Teachers get a week. Veterans get national holidays. Without system administrators, this world that we live in stops dead, cold in its tracks. Go hug your sys admins. We get screamed at an awful lot, and we don’t pull the plug on the world, which means we love you, in our own way.

System Administrators touch EVERYONE’s lives. Hug your sys admin!</span></span>
